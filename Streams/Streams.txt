1> Streams are mostly used to handle and manage streaming data like continuous data or big file.
2> We have four types of streams:-
--> Writeable - used to write data sequentially.
--> Readable - used to read data sequentially.
--> Duplex - used to do both read and write data sequentially.
--> Transform - used to modify data when writing or reading.
3> Streams and Events are used together.
